# Simple Models

We first introduce some simple models below just for illustration purposes. The first two are for elution curves and the last one for scattering curves.

* Gaussian Curve - for symmetric elution curves
* Exponential-Gaussian Hybrid - for asymmetric elution curves
* Sphere Scattering - for scattering curves

Theoretical discussion will be duly given in later chapters.
