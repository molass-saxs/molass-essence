    "\n",
    "* The stochastic theory of chromatography, originally conceived by Giddings and Eyring in 1955 {cite}`Giddings_1955`, was recast by Carmichael to represent SEC processes \n",
    "\n",
    "* Several important contributions to stochastic theory of chromatography appeared after the original Carmichaelâ€™s work on SEC. \n",
    "\n",
    "* However this advancement leads to complex mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With the introduction of the characteristic function (CF) method, the mathematical intractability was completely overcome.\n"
