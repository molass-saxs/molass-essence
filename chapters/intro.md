# Molass Library Essence

Molass Library is a rewrite of [MOLASS](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASSE.html) which is a tool for the analysis of SEC-SAXS experiment data currently hosted at [Photon Factory](https://www2.kek.jp/imss/pf/eng/) and [SPring-8](http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/), Japan. It is designed for scripting in Jupyter notebooks, thereby attaining greater flexibility compared to the predecessor thanks to the diversity of Python ecosystem.

This document describes the theoretical essence of the library, meaning that we will provide brief entries on each key point rather than exploring every subject in depth. Many topics are still under investigation, and it is more important for readers to be able to quickly try these ideas and see for themselves how they work than to present our elaborate but not yet fully established results.
