# SAXS Theory Basics

SAXS theory is used to interpret the spectral aspects of X-ray data.

Unfortunately, for the spectral aspects of UV data, there are not yet any usable theories available.

However, for the elutional aspects of both types of data, we can apply SEC theory, which will be briefly described in the next chapter.
