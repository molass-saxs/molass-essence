    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Plate theory quantifies the relationship between retention time and chromatographic peak width. In simple terms, the longer the retention time, the wider the peak. The concept of \"theoretical plates,\" introduced by Martin and Synge in 1941 {cite}`Martin1941-sz`, is rooted in the structure of Pascal’s triangle, which illustrates particle distribution across discrete stages. This distribution follows the binomial theorem, and as the number of plates increases, it approaches a Gaussian distribution—representing the symmetric case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, peak shapes can be asymmetric due to various effects. Models such as EMG (Exponentially Modified Gaussian {cite}`Foley_1984` or {cite}`Kalambet2011-us`) and EGH (Exponentially Gaussian Hybrid {cite}`LAN2001`) can be used to fit asymmetric peaks."

    "In the SEC theory context, retention time is supposed to be the time span from the injection to the elution peak point. See [Technical Report](https://freesemt.github.io/molass-technical/chapters/40/plate_number.html) for implementation details."
