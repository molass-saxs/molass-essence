Here, new developments in the {\it ATSAS 3.0} package are described. They include {\it IMSIM}, for simulating isotropic 2D scattering patterns; {\it IMOP}, to perform operations on 2D images and masks; {\it DATRESAMPLE}, a method for variance estimation of structural invariants through parametric resampling; {\it DATFT}, which computes the pair distance distribution function by a direct Fourier transform of the scattering data; {\it PDDFFIT}, to compute the scattering data from a pair distance distribution function, allowing comparison with the experimental data; a new module in {\it DATMW} for Bayesian consensus-based concentration-independent molecular weight estimation; {\it DATMIF}, an {\it ab initio} shape analysis method that optimizes the search model directly against the scattering data; {\it DAMEMB}, an application to set up the initial search volume for multiphase modelling of membrane proteins; {\it ELLLIP}, to perform quasi-atomistic modelling of liposomes with elliptical shapes; {\it NMATOR}, which models conformational changes in nucleic acid structures through normal mode analysis in torsion angle space; {\it DAMMIX}, which reconstructs the shape of an unknown intermediate in an evolving system; and {\it LIPMIX} and {\it BILMIX}, for modelling multilamellar and asymmetric lipid vesicles, respectively. In addition, technical updates were deployed to facilitate maintainability of the package, which include porting the {\it PRIMUS} graphical interface to Qt5, updating {\it SASpy} {--} a {\it PyMOL} plugin to run a subset of {\it ATSAS} tools {--} to be both Python 2 and 3 compatible, and adding utilities to facilitate mmCIF compatibility in future {\it ATSAS} releases. All these features are implemented in {\it ATSAS 3.0}, freely available for academic users at https://www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/software.html.},

Furthermore, there is now a {\it RAW} API, which can be used without the graphical user interface (GUI), providing full access to all of the functionality found in the GUI. In addition to these new capabilities, {\it RAW} has undergone significant technical updates, such as adding Python 3 compatibility, and has entirely new documentation available both online and in the program.},

abstract={Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

This matrix is decomposed by SVD into singular values and vectors to construct rank-one matrices. The application of the inverse mapping to the singular value related summation of these matrices yields a noise reduced signal vector. The scree test is used to select the rank-one matrices. Efficient storage of these signal driven matrices is realized by storing related singular values and vectors. The application of the method to simulated and biomedical signals shows its potential.}

    abstract = {Small angle scattering of X-rays (SAXS) and neutrons (SANS) is an established method for the structural characterisation of biological objects in a broad size-range from individual macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids) to large macromolecular complexes. The last decade has seen a renaissance in the study of low-resolution structure of native macromolecules in solution which provides overall particle shapes ab initio and is able to rapidly assess the oligomeric states of proteins and complexes. SAXS/SANS is complementary to the high-resolution methods of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance, allowing for hybrid modelling and also accounting for available biophysical and biochemical data. Quantitative characterisation of flexible macromolecular systems and mixtures has recently become possible. SAXS/SANS measurements can be performed easily in different conditions, adding ligands or changing physical and/or chemical parameters. This also provides kinetic information about processes such as folding and assembly, and allows one to analyse intermolecular interactions. The major factors promoting the increasing use of SAXS/SANS are modern high-brilliance X-ray and neutron sources, novel data-analysis methods and automation of the experiment, data processing and interpretation. In this book, following the presentation of the basics of scattering from macromolecular solutions, modern instrumentation, experimental practice and advanced analysis techniques are explained. Advantages of X-rays (rapid data collection, small sample volumes) and of neutrons (contrast variation by hydrogen/deuterium exchange) are specifically highlighted. Examples of applications of the technique to different macromolecular systems are considered, with specific emphasis on the synergistic use of SAXS/SANS with other structural, biophysical and computational techniques.},

    abstract = {The technique of small angle solution scattering has been revolutionized in the last two decades. Exponential increases in computing power, parallel algorithm development, and the development of synchrotron, free-electron X-ray sources, and neutron sources, have combined to allow new classes of studies for biological specimens. These include time-resolved experiments in which functional motions of proteins are monitored on a picosecond timescale, and the first steps towards determining actual electron density fluctuations within particles. In addition, more traditional experiments involving the determination of size and shape, and contrast matching that isolate substructures such as nucleic acid, have become much more straightforward to carry out, and simultaneously require much less material. These new capabilities have sparked an upsurge of interest in solution scattering on the part of investigators in related disciplines. Thus, this book seeks to guide structural biologists to understand the basics of small angle solution scattering in both the X-ray and neutron case, to appreciate its strengths, and to be cognizant of its limitations. It is also directed at those who have a general interest in its potential. The book focuses on three areas: theory, practical aspects and applications, and the potential of developing areas. It is an introduction and guide to the field but not a comprehensive treatment of all the potential applications.},

abstract = {Many experimental methods are available for the characterization of nanostructures, but most of them are limited by stringent experimental conditions. When it comes to analysing nanostructures in the bulk or in their natural environment {--} even as ordinary as water at room temperature {--} small-angle scattering (SAS) of X-rays or neutrons is often the only option. The rapid worldwide development of synchrotron and neutron facilities over recent decades has opened unprecedented possibilities for using SAS {\it in situ} and in a time-resolved way. But, in spite of its huge potential in the field of nanomaterials in general, SAS is covered far less than other characterization methods in non-specialized curricula. Presented here is a rigorous discussion of small-angle scattering, at a technical level comparable to the classical undergraduate coverage of X-ray diffraction by crystals and which contains diffraction as a particular case.},
